[![License: CERN-OHL-P-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-CERN--OHL--P--2.0-blue)](https://cern-ohl.web.cern.ch/)

The **Extension Board for TriBoard TC3X7 V2.0** is an extender board designed for use with the [Infineon AURIX™ TC3X7 TriBoard](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-TriBoardManual_TC3X71-UserManual-v02_01-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d462696dbf1201697775dd0b58be). It is 4-layer board based on JLC04161H-7628 standard stackup

It provides male headers for easy access to each IO and AN (Analog Input) pin from the four 80-pin connectors available on the original TriBoard.

✅ Fully compatible with:
- **TC397**
- **TC387**
- **TC377**
- **TC3E7**

⚠️ **Not compatible with**:
